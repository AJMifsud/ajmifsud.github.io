					<p>Welcome to dunghead! A card game for 2 to 4 players!<br><br></p>
					<p>At the start of the game, each player is dealt three cards facing down. These cards cannot be viewed or played until later in the game.<br><br>
						Each player is then dealt three cards facing up, which are placed on top of their "face down" cards. Like the face down cards, these cards cannot be played until later in the game.<br><br>
						Finally, each player is dealt three more cards to go into their hand, and the remainder of the deck becomes the draw pile<br><br><br>
						Before the first player plays their card, players are able to swap any of the cards in their hand with any of their face up cards. This allow for strategic play later in the game.<br><br>
						Each turn, a player must select a card from their hand to play. The selected card must always be equal to or higher than the rank of the card on the top of the play pile, with "Ace" being the highest.<br><br>
						If there is no cards in the play pile, any card may be played<br><br>
						Every time a player plays a card from their hand, if the number of cards in their hand drops below three, they must draw a card from the draw pile until they have three cards in their hand.<br><br>
						(On this page, this is done automatically)<br><br>
						If a player cannot play higher than the last played card, they must pick up all of the cards in the play pile and add them to their hand. (This is also done automatically)<br><br>
						However! Players can act strategically by using "trick" cards!<br><br>
						Trick cards are cards with a rank of either "2", "3", "7", or "10", and can be played on top of ANY card, regardless to whether it is higher in rank or not.<br><br>
						In addition to being able to be played at any time, each trick card has its own special ability!
					</p>
					<h2>Trick Card Abilities</h2>
					<div id="trick-cards-desc">
						<div class="trick-card">

							<div class="card-desc">
								When a 2 is played, the player who played it is able to play again, playing any card from their current selection.
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="trick-card">
							<img src="images/cards/3_of_Diamonds.png" alt="3">
							<div class="card-desc">
								When a 3 is played, the next player in the rotation has their turn skipped. (For example, in a 3 player game, if Player 1 plays a 3, in then skips player 2 and becomes player 3's turn.)
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="trick-card">
							<img src="images/cards/7_of_Hearts.png" alt="7">
							<div class="card-desc">
								When a 7 is played, the next player in the rotation MUST play a card with a rank below 7 or a trick card.
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="trick-card">
							<img src="images/cards/10_of_Spades.png" alt="10">
							<div class="card-desc">
								When a 10 is played, the pile of played cards is flushed away and are out of play for the remainder of the game. These cards cannot be recalled.
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						After the draw pile has run out of cards, and players have depleted the cards in their hand, they may then begin using the face up cards they were dealt at the start of the game.<br><br>
						Once these cards have been depleted, players are then able to select cards from their face down collection. But beware, these cards are a mystery until they have been played<br><br>
						Once the player has selected which of the face down cards they would like to play, they cannot recall the card. The result of this play comes down to luck.<br><br><br>
						If a player manages to play all of the cards from their hand, face up collection and face down collection, they are out of the game and cannot lose.<br><br>
						The last player remaining with any cards in their hand, face up collection or face down collection while all other players are out is declared the <b><u>DUNGHEAD!</u></b>
